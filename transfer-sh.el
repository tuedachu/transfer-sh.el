;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides an interface to the transfer-sh website.
;; Calling the transfer-sh-upload function will upload either the
;; currently active region or the complete buffer (if no region is
;; active) to transfer.sh.  The remote file name is determined by the
;; buffer name and the prefix/suffix variables.
